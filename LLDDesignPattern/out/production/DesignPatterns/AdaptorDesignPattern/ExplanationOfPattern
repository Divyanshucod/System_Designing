/*
Adaptor Pattern is most commonly use design pattern this is very relatable to real world more then any other
patterns that we learn till now.
Most common example is -> adaptor that use to connect wires in different - different sockets.
what -<> Adaptor Design pattern is a pattern that works as a bridge between existing interface and expecting/desired interface.
it helps you convert one thing to another thing. Ex-.
 Let's say you are creating a backend that send results in xml format but your client only understands JSON so how you make
 you result compatible to client. it just simple write simple code to convert simple code to convert xml to JSON.
 but there is a problem you do this it will work but if in the future if you want another conversion let say XML to html then
 You will again write code. and update the whole previous code so that it can adapt but you are violating the OPP(open/close)

 so it better to create separate interface and class to handle all thses things.

 problem i have used to demonstrate the use of this pattern is (Shopping Cart Payment system).
