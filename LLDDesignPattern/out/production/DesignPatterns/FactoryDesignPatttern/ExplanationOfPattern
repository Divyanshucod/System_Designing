/*
  what -> factory design patten is a pattern which is used in a situations where we want to create a object dynamically on the basis of certain situations
  it will create object for you without disclosing a actual logic of how the objects are creating, you are creating objects via
  abstraction layer say factory without rely on actual concrete class, which make this flexible,loose coupling,maintainable etc.

  I have used an example(DataBase Connection System) where you are connecting to different database and this is very useful when you are working
  with multiple databases for storing and retrieval.  
  and i also coded the basic system to demonstrate this real world example clearly.

  One Example that you can try by yourself is shape creation where you have shape as factory and inside this u are creating a multiple objects like -> 
  square,triangle,rectangle,circle..etc and another interface say DRAW and contains draw function and implement this draw method for different shapes.
