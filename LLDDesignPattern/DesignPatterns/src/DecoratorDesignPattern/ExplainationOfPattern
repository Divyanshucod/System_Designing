/*
   What -> Decorator Design Pattern is a most commonly used design pattern Ex. pizza shop,coffee shop (these are
   the places where you offen go for eat and drink(to wake up your self).
   In this pattern we will have only one base class and we can add more features in this itself. instead of creating multiple
   classes for each feature. same as pizza, initially we have base pizza with limited amount of toppings or cheese etc.
   but what if you are a person who love cheese or more spice, then what you will do, you can tell the baker or person who are giving/packing pizzas
   to add more cheese, so what that person do, will they create new pizza or add topping or cheese to existing one.
   obviously second option. same why this work in programming. "" apart from creating multiple class you will just create one decorator class and start
   decorating the baseobj in this way it will help to avoid class explosion and you don't need to create multiple object multiple time"".

   To Demonstrate this i have created a simple design/system "Text formatting" how text formation work. and you can add more things like
   aligning the text,space between text etc etc.
