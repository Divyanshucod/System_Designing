/*
  this is a another important pattern that also offen uses in day to day life.
  what -> observer design patten is a pattern which is used in a situations where we want to notify about the change,state,status
  of thing to the devices who are observing this thing. where this thing is (observable) and devices are (observers)

  I have used an example(Post feed notification) where all the followers will get notify about the new post when user upload any.
  and i also coded the basic system to demonstrate this real world example clearly.

  // why the code for before and after are same in mainclass2.
  In before the implementations are different , in Before package you can see that List of observers that  we are storing directly using concrete class
  rather then abstraction so if any change happen in follower class then it will effect the user class as well.
  but in After package u can see that list of observers that we are storing depends upon abstraction(interface).
