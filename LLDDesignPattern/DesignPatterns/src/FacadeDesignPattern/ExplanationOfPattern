/*
 what ->this is a pattern that we use to hide complexities of system.
 ex. lets say you have to build a cars with methods like acceleration,break,clutch. but we all know these will not work along
 we will require more other classes and object that can interact to each other and operate together to give one specific functionality
 like acceleration there could be other methods and class that handle speeding up wheels, handle fuel exhaustion(more fuel will be use is speeding up)
 and many more.

 Note -> it does not enforce client to use that facade layer the client can also access those complex methods as well.

 i have used example (Vide Player System) you can see the explanation in the post on linkedIn
