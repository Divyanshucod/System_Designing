 what -> this is a step by step object creation system.in this we create a object in the specific order.
 ex. lets say you have to build a house then to build house we requires a some important things at very basic level(walls,roof,rooms,doors,windows etc etc).
 but we also know we can not create any thing at any level like we can create door before the rooms, and same way can't rooms before wall.
 so we want specific order to create objects. it also helps to avoid complex constructor structure 'think this through'
 assume you have to create a system to manage student detail and for each student you may have lot of information like.
 name,id,rollno,address,subjects,parents information, admission and many more, so just imagine how big you constructor will be to manage those information
 you can simplify this using this pattern.

 i have used example (cars manufacture System) you can see the explanation in the post on linkedIn.
