    here we talk about the easiest yet important design principle called single resposibility principle
    What -> so in a simpler manner it says that the class should have only one reason to change. simple ðŸ˜Ž
    Why -> It helps to increase manageability,reliability,flexibility.
    How it works? Let's understand with example.
    consider you have to design a billing system where the only functionalities
    you have to add is generate invoice and print that invoice "invoice -> "arre bhai bill receipt ki bat kar raha hu""
    so you might be thinking we can create one class to handle both the things via creating functions like GenerateInvoice
    , PrintInvoice. but if you do that you will violate the SRP(Single-Responsibility-Principle). but how? because there will be two reason
    to change the class(methods), "hui na violation kyoki hame to ek hi reason chahiye na ki two."
    what if in future you wanna change the method of generating bill and also what if you want to add new device to print
    invoice in this way you will have two reasons to change the class. but SRP say's hi! i told you i want only one reason to change.

    let's implement this and see how will it work. Before and After
