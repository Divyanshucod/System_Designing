   Hi! you guys have come let's start.
   Open Close principle is a very principle and believe me you can only understand the importance of this when you will work
   on projects that require updation(changing code to handle other case) at the same time when your other functionality and method still using you methods
   on that which you wanna update. so what will be you first approach update the existing one and to do this you have to put your server down,
   but it will effect you application availability. and second approach is to utilize the open close principle.
   What -> so keep it simple it says that you class should open for extention and should close for modification. simple ðŸ˜Ž
   Why -> creating scalable application so that i future we can add more features without effecting the other one.

   let's understand this via example.
   Example -> let's create a notification system where we are sending notifications via email,push-notification, or any other
   method. one possible thing that you can do to implement this feature, create a class say notification and add notification methods
   and select via if else case, but it is not future proof.what if in the future you wanna add new method to send notification
   maybe via mobile no then you have to update the existing code otherwise you can't send the notification via mobile no.
   see example before after for better clarification.
